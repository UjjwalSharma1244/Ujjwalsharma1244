Hi 👋, I'm Ujjwal, a Full-Stack .NET Developer

I’m a passionate Software Engineer with 3.8+ years of experience in building scalable web applications and APIs.
I specialize in C#, ASP.NET Core, SQL Server, and Cloud (Azure & AWS), and I’m currently expanding my skills in frontend technologies like React to become a complete full-stack developer.

My focus is on building reliable, performant, and user-centric applications by combining backend robustness with modern frontend experiences.

Whether I’m designing secure APIs, architecting cloud-native solutions, or experimenting with new frontend frameworks, I’m always driven to create impactful, high-quality software solutions.
